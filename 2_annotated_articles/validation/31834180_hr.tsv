Eccentric versus Concentric - Which Is the Most Stressful Cardiovascularly and Metabolically?
The purpose of this study was to compare the fatigability resistance profile and the physiological responses of strenuous concentric (CON) versus eccentric (ECC) isokinetic exercises.
At two different sessions, 12 healthy sedentary male subjects (24.3 ± 2.5 years) performed strenuous CON and ECC isokinetic exercises.
The protocol consisted of three sets of 12 maximal repetitions, separated by 30-s intervals, at a velocity of 60°·s for both flexor and extensor knee muscles of the dominant leg.
Metabolic (ventilation, oxygen uptake, blood lactate concentration) and cardiovascular (HR, mean arterial blood pressure) parameters were registered before, throughout, and after the isokinetic session.
The isokinetic data analysis revealed a more pronounced fatigue in the hamstrings than in the quadriceps in the ECC mode (fatigue index, ratio between the third and the first sets, of 94.8% ± 11.8% vs 86.4% ± 10.8%; P < 0.05).
All physiological responses studied increased gradually during the isokinetic evaluation, both in CON and ECC modes.
For total work normalized by physiological responses, cardiovascular and metabolic variables were lower in the CON than in the ECC mode, a sign of a weaker efficiency in CON mode (ratio between performance and physiological cost).
In conclusion, the study shows a specific fatigability resistance profile consisting of an early decrease of ECC hamstring performance compared with the quadriceps profile.
In addition, we confirm that physiological consequences are important during strenuous isokinetic exercises but ECC exercise produces less stress on the cardiovascular and the metabolic systems than does CON exercise.
