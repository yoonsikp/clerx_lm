Logic Gate Functions Built with Nonvolatile Resistive Switching and Thermoresponsive Memory Based on Biologic Proteins.
Logic gate functions built with nonvolatile resistive switching and thermoresponsive memory based on biologic proteins were investigated.
The "NAND" and "NOR" functions of logic gates in soya protein devices have been built at room temperature by their nonvolatile ternary WORM resistive switching behaviors.
Furthermore, heating the devices from room temperature to 358 K results in a switch from tristable state to bistable state WORM resistive switching behavior, indicating that the thermoresponsiveness can be efficiently memorized.
The biologic transient nonvolatile memory device consisting of soya protein is illustrated.
This device exhibits a long data retention time (104 s) and significant HRS/LRS ratio (~105); the transient response of the current to voltage of an as-fabricated device is also explored.
The soya protein based memory device on a gelatin film substrate is also assessed to validate the feasibility of degradation and biological compatibility for the implantable biological electronic device, that is, innoxious and avirulent to the human body.
This can offer alternative avenues for exploring prospective bioelectronic devices.
