Sudden Cardiac Death Risk Prediction in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) comprises 25% of the deaths in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
We sought to validate a SCD risk prediction model among patients who participated in the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial.
Of the 3,445 TOPCAT participants, 615 had data on all 6 variables (age, sex, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, bundle branch block, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide) of the SCD risk prediction model.
Those with a 5-year predicted risk of SCD ≥10% were categorized as high risk.
Over a mean 2.9 (±1.3) years of follow-up, there were 23 (3.7%) SCD and 63 (10.2%) deaths from other causes.
The mortality rate from SCD and other causes were 13 (95% CI: 9-19) and 35 (95% CI: 28-45) per 1,000 person-years of follow-up, respectively.
A total of 216 (35.1%) participants were categorized as high risk by the SCD risk model.
The estimated 5-year cumulative incidence of SCD was 15.2% (95% CI: 6.6-27.2) among those classified as high risk vs. 2.8% (95% CI: 1.2-5.5) for those classified as low risk.
In competing risk analysis, patients predicted to have high SCD risk had a 3.7-fold greater risk of SCD (HR 3.7; 95% CI: 1.6-8.7; p=0.003) than those predicted to have low risk.	3,109,112.1,38,69.2,101,104.6,151,177	1,2.1,3.1,4
The SCD risk model had a Harrell's C-index of 0.74.
A SCD risk prediction model of 6 widely-available variables can identify patients with HFpEF who had a high risk of SCD.
