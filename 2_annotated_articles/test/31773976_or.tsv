Tumor clinicopathological characteristics and their prognostic value in mucinous colorectal carcinoma.
Aim: This study analyzed clinicopathological features of colorectal mucinous carcinoma and their prognostic values.
Patients & method: This study enrolled 265 patients with mucinous colorectal cancer.
Clinicopathological information and prognosis were reviewed retrospectively.
Kaplan-Meier method, log- rank test and COX proportional hazard regression models were used.
Results: In postoperative mucinous carcinoma patients (median age 56, 119 [44.9%] female), advanced tumor stage (odds ratio [OR]: 2.378; 95% CI: 1.512-3.741; p = 0.0002), poor differentiation (OR: 1.896; CI: 1.217-2.955; p = 0.0047) and right-sided tumors (OR: 2.421; CI: 1.145-5.102; p = 0.0206) were associated with shorter overall survival.	4,131,136.4,198,203.4,262,267.1,13,54.1,92,112.1,172,192.1,238,256.2,327,343	1,8.2,8.3,8.1,4.2,4.3,4.1,5.2,6.3,7
Appendiceal/ileocecal cecal tumors were not different for prognosis.
Conclusion: Mucinous colorectal carcinoma exhibits distinct tumor characteristics.
Poor differentiation, advanced stage at presentation and the right side serve as negative prognostic factors.
