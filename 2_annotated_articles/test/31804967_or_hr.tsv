Impact of total thyroidectomy on quality of life at 6 months: the prospective ThyrQoL multicentre trial.
This study is to determine the impact of complications after total thyroidectomy on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), and to identify significant predictive factors of HR-QoL changes.
HR-QoL is usually impaired in patients with thyroid diseases compared to the general population.
Thyroidectomy is largely performed in case of benign thyroid benign, and can be associated with long-term complications (vocal cord palsy, hypoparathyroidism).
The prospective ThyrQoL multicentre trial (NCT02167529) included 800 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy for benign or malignant non-extensive disease in seven French referral hospitals between 2014 and 2016.
HR-QoL was assessed using the MOS 36-item short form health survey (SF-36) self-questionnaire with a 6-month follow-up.
We observed a significant improvement of HR-QoL 6 month after surgery (p< 0.0001).
Postoperative complications were associated with a non-significant impairment of HR-QoL.
In multivariate analysis, Graves' disease was associated with a significant improvement of HR-QoL (OR = 2.39 1.49; 3.84) and thyroid malignant disease with an impairment of HR-QoL (OR = 1.44 0.99; 2.08) after thyroidectomy.	4,105,109.4,189,193.1,27,42.2,77,98.1,128,153.2,162,182.1,208,227	1,3.2,5.1,4.2,6.1,7.2,7
We observed a significant improvement of HR-QoL 6 month after total thyroid surgery for benign thyroid disease.
