Risk of perioperative neck hematoma in TIA and non-disabling stroke patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis undergoing endarterectomy within 14 days from cerebrovascular event.
Perioperative neck hematoma (PNH) requiring re-intervention is an important complication after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
There are limited data regarding the potential risk factors associated with PNH.
The aim of this prospective, multicenter study was to document the rate of PNH in symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (sCAS) patients treated with CEA within the first 14 days of cerebrovascular symptom onset and to identify possible predictors of this complication.
Patients with non-disabling (mRS ≤ 2) acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack due to sCAS (≥70%) underwent CEA at three stroke-centers during a seven-year period.
PNH requiring surgical re-intervention or transfusion during a 30-day follow-up period was determined by the attending surgeon but was also confirmed by an independent neurologist.
A total of 280 patients with sCAS underwent CEA within 14 days of ictus.
PNH occurred in 10 cases (3.6%; 95%CI: 1.4%-5.8%).
Pretreatment with therapeutic anticoagulation (TA) and history of atrial fibrillation were more prevalent in patients with PNH (20% vs. 3.1%, p= 0.047 & 30% vs. 8.2%, p = 0.05 respectively).
Elapsed time between symptom onset and carotid surgery, pretreatment with dual antiplatelets, intravenous thrombolysis or prophylactic anticoagulation were not related to PNH in univariable analyses.
Pretreatment with TA was independently associated with higher likelihood of PNH [OR: 10.69, 95%CI (1.74-65.72), p = 0.011] in multivariate logistic regression models adjusting for potential confounders.	4,86,91.1,1,21.2,77,80	1,2.1,3
PNH is uncommon in patients with sCAS that are operated during the first 14 days of ictus.
Pretreatment with TA appears to be associated with higher risk of PNH.
