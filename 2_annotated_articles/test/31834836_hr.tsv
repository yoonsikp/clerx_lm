Exacerbated pressor and sympatho-excitatory effects of central Elabela in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
Elabela (ELA) is a newly discovered peptide that acts as a novel endogenous ligand of angiotensin receptor-like 1 (APJ) receptor.
This study was designed to evaluate the effects of ELA-21 in paraventricular nucleus (PVN) on blood pressure and sympathetic nerve activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).
Experiments were performed in male Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHR.
ELA expression was up-regulated in PVN of SHR.
PVN microinjection of ELA-21 increased renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), plasma norepinephrine (NE) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels in SHR.
Intravenous injection of ELA-21 significantly decreased MAP and HR in both WKY and SHR, but only induced a slight decrease in RSNA.
APJ antagonist F13A in PVN abolished the effects of ELA-21 on RSNA, MAP and HR.
Intravenous infusion of both ganglionic blocker hexamethonium and AVP V1a receptor antagonist SR49059 caused significant reduction in the effects of ELA-21 on RSNA, MAP and HR in SHR, while combined administration of hexamethonium and SR49059 abolished the effects of ELA-21.
ELA-21 microinjection stimulated Akt and p85Î± subunit of PI3K phosphorylation in PVN, whereas PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or Akt inhibitor MK-2206 almost abolished the effects of ELA-21 on RSNA, MAP and HR.
Chronic PVN infusion of ELA-21 induced sympathetic activation, hypertension and AVP release accompanied with cardiovascular remodeling in normotensive WKY.
In conclusion, ELA-21 in PVN induces exacerbated pressor and sympatho-excitatory effects in hypertensive rats via PI3K-Akt pathway.
