Clinico-epidemiological features and response in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia at regional cancer center of Northeast India.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) comprises 19.3% of all childhood cancers in Northeast India.
We analyzed clinicoepidemiological features and early response to the treatment of all the cases of childhood ALL (age <15 years) diagnosed and treated at Dr. B Borooah Cancer Institute over 1 year.
Of 52 eligible cases, 69% were male (male:female ratio of 2.2:1) and the mean age was 7.1 years.
Thirty-three children (63%) had baseline white blood cell count ≥20 × 109/L.
Precursor B-cell was most the common subtype seen in 61% of children.
Seven cases (14%) had high-risk (HR) cytogenetics, with t (9,22) being the most common one.
Male sex and HR cytogenetics were significantly associated with poor early responses.
ALL is a common childhood malignancy with high cure rates.
However, poor socioeconomic status and the presence of higher proportions of disease-related factors lead to poor outcome in this part of the country.
