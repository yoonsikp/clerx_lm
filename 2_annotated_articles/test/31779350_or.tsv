ChaosNet: A chaos based artificial neural network architecture for classification.
Inspired by chaotic firing of neurons in the brain, we propose ChaosNet-a novel chaos based artificial neural network architecture for classification tasks.
ChaosNet is built using layers of neurons, each of which is a 1D chaotic map known as the Generalized Lur√∂th Series (GLS) that has been shown in earlier works to possess very useful properties for compression, cryptography, and for computing XOR and other logical operations.
In this work, we design a novel learning algorithm on ChaosNet that exploits the topological transitivity property of the chaotic GLS neurons.
The proposed learning algorithm gives consistently good performance accuracy in a number of classification tasks on well known publicly available datasets with very limited training samples.
Even with as low as seven (or fewer) training samples/class (which accounts for less than 0.05% of the total available data), ChaosNet yields performance accuracies in the range of 73.89%-98.33%.
We demonstrate the robustness of ChaosNet to additive parameter noise and also provide an example implementation of a two layer ChaosNet for enhancing classification accuracy.
We envisage the development of several other novel learning algorithms on ChaosNet in the near future.
