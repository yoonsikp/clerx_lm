Cu-nanoflower decorated gold nanoparticles-graphene oxide nanofiber as electrochemical biosensor for glucose detection.
A novel electrospinning approach is proposed for the fabrication of copper (Cu)-nanoflower decorated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-graphene oxide (GO) nanofiber (NF) as an electrochemical biosensor for the glucose detection.
In this study, GO was mixed with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and used as a fiber precursor, which greatly improves the electrochemical properties.
The above solution was uniformly coated onto the surfaces of gold chip to form GO NFs via electrospinning.
AuNPs were coated onto the surface of GO NFs and then incorporated organic-inorganic hybrid nanoflower [Cu nanoflower-glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)].
The electrochemical experiments revealed that Cu-nanoflower@AuNPs-GO NFs exhibited outstanding electrochemical catalytic nature, and selectivity for the conversion of glucose to gluconic acid in the presence of GOx-HRP-Cu nanoflower.
The Cu-nanoflower@AuNPs-GO NFs coated Au chip exhibited good linear range 0.001-0.1 mM, with a detection limit of 0.018 Î¼M.
The Cu-nanoflower@AuNPs-GO NFs modified Au chip exhibited higher catalytic properties, which are attributed to the coating of unique organic-inorganic nanostructured materials on the surfaces of Au chip.
These results indicate that the nano-bio hybrid materials can be applied as a promising electrochemical biosensor to monitor glucose levels in biofluids.
