Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Police Reporting for Partner Violence in the National Crime Victimization Survey and Survivor-Led Interpretation.
Despite compromising women's health and safety, intimate partner violence (IPV) is among the most underreported crimes, and our understanding of factors that drive police reporting by race/ethnicity is underdeveloped.
The purpose of this study is to examine racial/ethnic differences in self-reporting IPV to police.
Race/ethnicity-stratified models identified predictors of reporting IPV to police among recent, female survivors (n = 898) in the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS; 2011-15).
Focus groups (n = 3) with recent survivors (n = 19) in Baltimore, MD (2018), contextualized results.
Black women in the NCVS were twice as likely to report IPV to police relative to White women (AOR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.01-4.15).	4,101,105.1,1,12.2,49,69.6,82,93	1,2.1,3.1,4
In race/ethnicity-stratified models, police reporting significantly increased with increasing age between 18 and < 35 years (AOR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05-1.33) for Black women, and with IPV-related injury for Black (AOR = 2.51, 95% CI: 1.10-5.71) and Hispanic women (AOR = 2.87, 95% CI: 1.22-6.71); Hispanics with less than a high school education were least likely to report (AOR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.07-0.91).	4,132,136.4,219,223.4,270,274.4,380,384.2,38,54.1,84,124.1,161,172.1,183,201.1,206,211.1,248,256.1,257,262.1,296,305.1,311,344.2,366,372	1,5.2,5.3,5.4,14.1,6.1,7.2,8.3,8.2,9.3,10.2,11.3,11.4,12.4,13
Focus groups explained racial/ethnic influences on reporting including a culture of silence and discrimination, socioeconomic status, and social desirability.
We identified influences on reporting IPV to police that vary by race/ethnicity using national data in context to an urban environment.
Results demonstrate the need to enhance equity in survivors' health and public safety through training and organizational change.
