Evasion of innate lymphoid cells-regulated IFNγ responses by Chlamydia muridarum to achieve long-lasting colonization in mouse colon.
Revealing the mechanisms by which bacteria establish long-lasting colonization in the gastrointestinal tract is an area of intensive investigation.
The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia is known to colonize mouse colon for long periods of time.
A colonization-deficient mutant strain of this intracellular bacterium is able to regain long-lasting colonization in IFNγ knockout mice following an intracolon inoculation.
We now report that mice deficient in conventional T lymphocytes or recombination activating gene (Rag) failed to rescue the mutant colonization.
Nevertheless, antibody depletion of IFNγ or genetic deletion of IL-2 receptor common gamma chain in Rag deficient mice did rescue mutant colonization.
These observations suggest that colonic IFNγ responsible for inhibiting the intracellular bacterium mutant is produced by innate lymphoid cells (ILCs).
Consistently, depletion of NK1.1+ cells in Rag deficient mice both prevented IFNγ production and rescued the bacterium mutant colonization.
Furthermore, mice deficient in transcriptional factor RORγt, but not chemokine receptor CCR6, fully rescued the long-lasting colonization of the mutant, indicating that the role of group 3-like ILCs.
However, the inhibitory function of the responsible group 3-like ILCs was not dependent on the natural killer cell receptor (NCR1) since NCR1-deficient mice still inhibited the mutant colonization.
Consistently, mice deficient in the transcriptional factor T-bet only delayed the clearance of the bacterial mutant without fully rescuing the long-lasting colonization of the mutant.
Thus, we have demonstrated that the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia maintains its long-lasting colonization in the colon by evading IFNγ from group 3-like ILCs.
