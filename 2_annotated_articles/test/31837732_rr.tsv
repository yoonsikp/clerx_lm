Meta-Analysis Comparing Double Versus Triple Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Coronary Artery Disease.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) and concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) create a therapeutic dilemma as the risk of bleeding with triple antithrombotic therapy (TATT) must be balanced against the risk of ischemic events with double antithrombotic therapy (DATT).
The aim of this meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy and safety of DATT versus TATT in AF and CAD.
MEDLINE, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for relevant articles published from inception to May 1, 2019.
Studies comparing the safety and efficacy of DATT versus TATT in patients with AF and CAD were included.
Among 9 studies, where 6,104 patients received DATT and 7,333 patients received TATT, there was no statistically significant difference in the outcomes of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and stroke.
There was a lower rate of major bleeding in DATT (risk ratio [RR] 0.64 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54 to 0.75]; p <0.001).	5,67,71.2,27,41.1,45,49	1,3.1,2
There was no significant difference in stent thrombosis (RR 1.52 [95% CI 0.97 to 2.38]; p = 0.07).	5,61,65.2,40,56	1,2
However, subgroup analysis of trials with direct oral anticoagulant use demonstrated a borderline higher rate of stent thrombosis in DATT (RR 1.66 [95% CI 1.01 to 2.73]; p = 0.05).	5,143,147.1,43,72.2,114,130.1,134,138	1,2.1,3.1,4
In conclusion, DATT showed no difference in the outcomes of mortality, stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis compared with TATT.
DATT demonstrated a lower rate of major bleeding.
DATT demonstrated a borderline higher rate of stent thrombosis in the subgroup analysis of trials with direct oral anticoagulant which needs to be evaluated in further studies.
