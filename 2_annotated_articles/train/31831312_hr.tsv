Cross-clamp location affects short-term survival in patients undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
Open abdominal aortic aneurysm (oAAA) repair in the era of advanced endovascular aortic techniques is used in challenging anatomy.
The impact of the location of the proximal aortic cross-clamp (suprarenal [SR] vs infrarenal [IR]) on outcomes remains to be determined.
The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of proximal aortic cross-clamp location on short-term and overall survival after oAAA repair in a contemporary series.
A retrospective cohort study was performed comparing the outcomes of patients undergoing oAAA repair with SR and IR aortic cross-clamping using the Vascular Quality Initiative registry from January 2003 to September 2018.
Our primary end point was short-term mortality.
There were 7601 patients who underwent oAAA repair.
Their mean age was 69.3 Â± 8.5 years and 5555 patients (73.1%) were male.
The aortic cross-clamp location was IR in 4044 patients (53.2%).
The SR group had increased maximum AAA diameter (58 mm vs 56 mm; P < .0001), hypertension (85.5% vs 82.0%; P < .0001), preoperative creatinine (1.11 vs 1.08; P = .001), and were more likely to be in American Society of Anesthesiologists class IV (37.4% vs 30.6%; P < .0001).
Postoperative renal failure occurred significantly more often in the SR group (24.4 vs 11.4%; P < .0001).
Short-term mortality was 2.7% in the IR group and 4.7% in the SR group (P < .0001).
Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were 93.7% and 83.8% in the IR group and 90.9% and 81.2% in the SR group at 1 and 5 years, respectively (P = .007).
Multivariable analysis demonstrated that SR cross-clamping was significantly associated with short-term mortality (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.78; P = .01); however, it did not affect overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.28; P = .06).	3,130,134.3,241,245.1,42,59.2,94,114.2,209,225	1,4.2,5.1,3.2,3
A SR cross-clamp location is associated with an increased short-term mortality in patients undergoing oAAA repair.
Overall survival is not affected by a SR cross-clamp location.
