Pharmacological interventions during the process of reconsolidation of aversive memories: A systematic review.
Reconsolidation is the return of a memory to a transient state of lability, following memory consolidation, that can occur when memories are evoked.
During the process of reconsolidation, memories may be modified by different means, including the administration of drugs, during a period called the "reconsolidation window".
This process has been widely studied in animals, but human studies are limited and include several methodological pitfalls.
Our objective was to conducte a systematic review of the literature that utilizes pharmacological interventions during the process of reconsolidation of aversive memories in humans, with a critical analysis of the methodologies used.
Searches were made in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and SciELO using the following search terms: (memory) AND (consolidation OR reconsolidation) AND (pharmacological manipulation OR pharmacological intervention).
We found 294 references and ten (3.4%) were included in the review, based on preestablished eligibility criteria.
All studies were randomized, double-blind clinical trials.
The most commonly studied drug was propranolol.
Two studies used a protocol involving autobiographical aversive memories, while in the remaining aversive memories were produced in the laboratory.
The timing of pharmacological interventions is a controversial issue in the field, as drug activity must occur within the reconsolidation window.
The small number of studies and some methodological difficulties of this type of research highlights the need for studies that individually evaluate some of the issues discussed, particularly the timing of pharmacological interventions and the duration of reconsolidation windows.
