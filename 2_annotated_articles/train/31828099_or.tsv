Genetic Variants in Group-Specific Component (GC) Gene Are Associated with Breast Cancer Risk among Chinese Women.
The group-specific component (GC) gene, one of the vitamin D pathway genes, seems to play an important role in cancer development.
A population-based breast cancer study including 818 cases and 935 controls in a Chinese population was carried out to evaluate the potential associations of four polymorphisms (rs16847024, rs17467825, rs2298850, and rs3755967) in the GC gene with risk of breast cancer.
We detected three SNPs with statistically significant effects on breast cancer development after adjusting for age, menopausal status, body mass index (BMI), family history of breast cancer, income, waist circumference, and education (rs17467825: adjusted OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.65-0.99; rs2298850: adjusted OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.65-0.98; rs3755967: adjusted OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.65-0.98).	4,262,266.4,313,317.4,364,368.2,66,91.1,19,23.1,236,246.1,288,297.1,339,348	1,5.2,5.3,5.1,6.2,7.3,8.1,4.2,4.3,4
Stratified analysis found that when an individual had a waist circumference <80 cm, rs17467825, rs2298850, and rs3755967 could markedly reduce the risk of breast cancer.
Significant interactions between polymorphisms of rs2298850 and rs3755967 and waist circumference were also observed for breast cancer risk.
Combined analysis revealed a significant association among the allele numbers of protective effects with decreased breast cancer risk (P trend=0.043).
These results indicated that, in the GC gene, genetic mutations might be related to breast cancer susceptibility in Chinese women.
