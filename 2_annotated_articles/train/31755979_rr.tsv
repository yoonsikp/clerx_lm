PPV, Retinectomy, and Silicone Oil Without Scleral Buckle for Recurrent RRD From Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy.
To analyze the anatomic success rate of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), retinectomy, and silicone oil (SO) tamponade without scleral buckle (SB) for repair of recurrent rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) associated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR).
Retrospective, consecutive, single-surgeon case series of 28 eyes of 28 patients with PVR-associated RRD repaired with PPV, retinectomy, and SO tamponade without SB.
The single-procedure anatomic success rate was 85.2% at 3 months and 82.1% at 12 months.
Final reattachment rate was 100.0%.
There were no preoperative factors that predicted single procedure anatomic success.
Mean logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution visual acuity (VA) was improved at 3 months (1.61 to 1.51, P = .732) and at 12 months (1.61 to 1.41; P = .271).
VA outcome was related to preoperative macula and lens status.
The single-procedure anatomic success rate of PPV, retinectomy, and SO tamponade without SB for PVR-related recurrent RRD is comparable to prior reports of similar surgery incorporating SB.
