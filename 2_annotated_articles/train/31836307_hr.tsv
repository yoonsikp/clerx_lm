Distinct trajectories in HbA1c are associated with different all-cause mortality and morbidity in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes.
To identify trajectories of long-term HbA1c levels and examine associations with subsequent risk for morbidity and mortality.
We conducted a longitudinal follow-up among 27,724 patients, newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, in a large healthcare organization.
We identified trajectories of long-term HbA1c levels during the first 5 years post diabetes onset to examine associations with subsequent risk for morbidity and all-cause mortality.
We identified two HbA1c trajectories; the "Steady-plateau HbA1c trajectory" in 93% of patients and a "Sharp-incline HbA1c trajectory" in 7% of patients.
When compared to the steady-plateau group, patients in the sharp-incline group were younger, male, from a lower socio-economic background, and higher levels of HbA1c at baseline.
Patients in the sharp-incline trajectory had a HR = 1.83 (95%CI: 1.58-2.12) for all-cause mortality, HR = 1.99 (95%CI: 1.74-2.27) for cardiovascular disease, and HR = 1.68 (95%CI: 1.51-1.86) for renal disease, compared to patients in the steady-plateau trajectory.	3,53,57.3,107,111.3,168,172.1,17,41.2,81,100.2,135,157.2,196,209.6,239,264	1,5.2,6.3,7.1,4.2,4.3,4.1,8.2,8.3,8
Patients in the sharp-incline trajectory had a higher risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease, compared to patients in the steady-plateau trajectory.
Estimation of HbA1c variability in the first years of diagnosis may be a useful indicator of those patients at high risk for diabetes related complications.
