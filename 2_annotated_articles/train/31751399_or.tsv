Pharmacologic management of HCV treatment in patients with HCV monoinfection vs. HIV/HCV coinfection: Does coinfection really matter?
Sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) monoinfection and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfection treated with direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy are similar in clinical trials.
The objective of this study was to examine differences in patient characteristics, drug-drug interactions, and treatment pathways between these groups in a real-world clinical setting.
We performed an ambispective review of patients prescribed DAA therapy between September 2015 and April 2018 at a tertiary academic center.
The primary endpoint was time from a decision to treat to treatment initiation.
Secondary endpoints included patient characteristics; frequency and type of DAA medication interactions; frequency, type, and timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) changes; and treatment outcomes.
Three hundred and twelve patients were included.
Almost half (43%) were HIV/HCV coinfected.
Patients with HIV/HCV coinfection were more likely to be African American (p<0.001), have a diagnosed psychiatric disorder (p<0.001) and have a higher pill burden (p = 0.014).
Patients with HIV/HCV coinfection were more likely to report an alcohol abuse history (p<0.001), injection drug use history (p<0.024), or active use of illicit substances (p = 0.019).
In a multivariable regression model assessing the primary endpoint, time to treatment initiation was increased in patients requiring a change in ART therapy (OR = 9.2, p < 0.001) or a non-ART medication adjustment (OR = 2.4, p = 0.003), and in patients with Medicaid (OR = 6.7, p < 0.001).	4,164,167.4,221,224.4,274,277.2,69,97.1,136,157.1,185,214.1,259,267.2,51,67	1,5.2,6.3,7.1,4.2,4.3,4.1,8.2,8.3,8
After controlling for all these factors, HIV/HCV coinfection still significantly impacted time to treatment initiation (OR = 1.7, p = 0.020).	4,126,129.1,42,61.2,91,119	1,2.1,3
The groups had similar rates of drug interaction frequency, treatment completion, observed SVR, and side effects.
Patients with HIV/HCV coinfection are more likely to have a variety of factors that add complexities to HCV treatment.
In addition to these challenges, patients with HIV/HCV coinfection experience a longer time to treatment initiation while patients with HCV monoinfection were more frequently lost to care.
Care delivery models may incorporate this data to improve patient engagement, access, and outcomes.
