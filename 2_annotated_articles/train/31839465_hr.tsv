Does having a seasonal influenza program facilitate pandemic preparedness? An analysis of vaccine deployment during the 2009 pandemic.
National seasonal influenza programs have been recommended as a foundation for pandemic preparedness.
During the 2009 pandemic, WHO aimed to increase Member States' equitable access to influenza vaccines through pandemic vaccine donation.
This analysis explores whether the presence of a seasonal influenza program contributed to more rapid national submission of requirements to receive vaccine during the 2009 influenza pandemic.
Data from 2009 influenza vaccine donation, deployment, and surveillance initiatives were collected during May-September 2018 from WHO archival material.
Data about the presence of seasonal influenza vaccine programs prior to 2009 were gathered from the WHO-UNICEF Joint Reporting Form.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the relationship between presence of a seasonal influenza program and time to submission of a national deployment and vaccination plan and to vaccine delivery.
Of 97 countries eligible to receive WHO-donated vaccine, 83 (86%) submitted national deployment and vaccination plans and 77 (79%) received vaccine.
Countries with a seasonal influenza vaccine program were more likely to submit a national deployment and vaccination plan (hazards ratio [HR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI].	3,143,146.1,18,52.2,73,122	1,2.1,3
Countries with regulatory delays were less likely to receive vaccine than those without these delays (HR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.6).	3,106,109.1,16,33.2,54,69.6,81,101	1,2.1,3.1,4
During the 2009 pandemic, eligible countries with a seasonal influenza vaccine program weremore ready to receive and use donated vaccines than those without a program.
Our findings suggest that robust seasonal influenza vaccine programs increase national familiarity with the management of influenza vaccines and therefore enhance pandemic preparedness.
