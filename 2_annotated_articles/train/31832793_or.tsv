Implant survival or implant success? Evaluation of implant-based prosthetic rehabilitation in head and neck cancer patients-a prospective observational study.
Definition of implant success is unclear in prosthetic implant-based rehabilitation of head neck cancer patients.
Fifty-two patients with 309 inserted implants were included in this prospective observational study.
Implant survival (in situ and loaded) and implant success (modified Albrektsson criteria) at 2-year follow-up were evaluated under the influence of patient- and implant-specific variables.
Thirty-nine patients with 234 implants finished the study.
Overall implant survival after 2 years was 92.3% (216/234) with an osseointegration rate of 94% (220/234).
Implant success was 78.6% (184/234).
Main reasons for failure were "bone resorption > 1.7mm" (n = 27, 11.5%) and "implant not in situ or not loaded" (n = 18, 7.7%).
Smoking (OR 3.1, p = 0.034), bone grafts (OR 2.4, p = 0.021) and radiation dose > 60 Gy (OR 3.8, p = 0.025) revealed as significant predictors for implant failure.	4,13,16.4,46,49.4,93,96.2,148,163.1,1,8.1,30,41.1,66,88	1,5.2,6.3,7.1,4.2,4.3,4
Implant survival differs significantly from implant success in head and neck cancer patients.
Implant success is mainly determined by radiographic peri-implant bone resorption.
Dealing with head and neck cancer patients a higher amount of peri-implant bone resorption must be taken into account and warrants for intensified implant monitoring.
