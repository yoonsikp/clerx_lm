Maternal psychopathology and offspring mental health service utilization in adolescents without mental disorders: a national representative survey.
We investigated whether maternal psychopathology predicts offspring mental health service utilization in adolescents without mental disorders.
We used weighted data (N = 2317) from NCS-A participants (age: 13-18 years) who did not meet DSM-IV criteria for any lifetime mental disorder.
Adolescent mental disorders were assessed with the WHO CIDI.
Maternal psychopathology was obtained by self-report.
Adolescent mental health service use was assessed with the Service Assessment for Children and Adolescents.
Substantial associations between maternal psychopathology and mental health service use in offspring without mental disorders were found between affective disorders and the mental health/medical specialty (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.60-3.90) and any service sector (HR = 2.14, CI = 1.45-3.16), anxiety disorders and any service sector (HR = 1.63, CI = 1.13-2.35), behavior disorders and the school (HR = 3.69, CI = 1.39-9.77) and any service sector (HR = 2.81, CI = 1.12-7.07), substance use disorders and the mental health/medical specialty (HR = 3.75, CI = 1.75-8.03), the school (HR = 3.17, CI = 1.43-7.02), and any service sector (HR = 3.66, CI = 2.00-6.70), and any mental disorder and the mental health/medical specialty (HR = 2.10, CI = 1.34-3.30) and any service sector (HR = 2.03, CI = 1.40-2.92).	3,227,231.3,304,308.3,374,378.3,437,441.3,488,492.3,581,585.3,621,625.3,673,677.3,766,770.3,817,821.1,34,58.2,63,126.1,146,165.2,174,205.2,279,297.1,327,344.2,349,367.1,397,415.2,424,430.2,463,481.1,511,534.2,543,574.2,608,614.2,648,666.1,700,719.2,728,759.2,792,810	1,11.1,12.2,11.2,12.3,11.3,12.4,11.4,12.5,11.5,12.6,11.6,12.7,11.7,12.8,11.8,12.9,11.9,12.10,11.10,12.1,13.1,14.2,13.2,15.3,16.3,17.4,18.4,19.5,18.5,20.6,21.6,22.7,21.7,23.8,21.8,24.9,25.9,26.10,25.10,27
Results were comparable when restricting analyses to offspring with no indication of suicidality and no more than three life events during the past 12 months.
The likelihood of service use was higher among offspring of mothers with mental disorders, compared to mothers without mental disorders.
Considering maternal mental disorder status may help to identify subjects at risk of overtreatment.
