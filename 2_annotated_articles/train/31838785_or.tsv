Nontraumatic spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Baseline characteristics and early outcomes.
Hemorrhagic stroke, particularly nontraumatic spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH), is a cerebrovascular condition with unfavorable outcomes.
The aims of the present study were to evaluate patients who suffered from SICH and investigate the early outcomes in a single-center study.
During a study -period of 6 years (2008-2014), 613 consecutive patients (mean age, 72 ± 12.7 years; 51.1% female), who suffered from nontraumatic SICH and were treated at the Department of Neurology at the University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Lübeck, Germany, were included and prospectively analyzed.
During a mean hospitalization time of 12 days, 148 patients (24.1%) died, 47% of those within the first 2 days and 79% within the first week.
The patients who died stayed at the hospital for a shorter time (3) than those who survived (p < .001).
In the multivariate logistic regression, following parameters were found to be associated with the in-hospital mortality: female sex (OR, 2.0; 95%-CI, 1.2-3.4; p = .009), a NIHSS score> 10 (OR, 10.5; 95%-CI, 5.6-19.5; p < .001), history of hypertension (OR, 0.35; 95%-CI, 0.19-0.64; p = .001), previous oral anticoagulation (OR, 2; 95%-CI, 1.0-3.8; p = .032), and intraventricular extension of hemorrhage (OR, 2.8; 95%-CI, 1.7-4.7; p = .001).	4,139,142.4,195,199.4,259,263.4,330,331.4,411,414.2,100,121.1,123,133.1,174,189.1,230,253.1,295,324.1,365,405	1,7.2,8.3,9.4,10.5,11.1,6.2,6.3,6.4,6.5,6
At discharge, 192 patients (41.2%) showed favorable outcomes (mRS ≤ 2) whereas the median mRS of patients who survived was 3 (IQR 2-4).
The good functional outcome at discharge from the acute hospital was decreased by an age> 70 years (OR, 0.56; 95%-CI, 0.35-0.9; p = .017), NIHSS score> 10 at admission (OR, 0.07; 95%-CI, 0.04-0.13; p < .001), and development of pneumonia during hospitalization (OR, 0.35; 95%-CI, 0.2-0.6; p < .001).	4,105,109.4,174,178.4,267,271.2,5,65.1,86,99.1,140,168.1,214,261	1,5.2,6.3,7.1,4.2,4.3,4
The present study showed that SICH is a serious disease causing high mortality and disability, particularly in the early period after event.
