Association between ambient temperature and daily emergency hospitalizations for acute coronary syndrome in Yancheng, China.
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a major public health concern worldwide.
Few studies have directly evaluated the associations between ambient temperature and ACS incidence.
To explore the association between ambient temperature and ACS emergency hospitalizations in the area of subtropical monsoon climate, data on ACS emergency hospitalizations were collected from two highest-ranking hospitals in the central urban area of Yancheng, China, from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018.
We applied the time-series method to investigate the potentially lagged and non-linear effects of ambient temperature on ACS using the generalized linear model combined with the distributed lag non-linear model after adjusting for time trend, day of the week, holiday, and relative humidity.
We identified a total of 5303 cases of ACS emergency hospitalizations during the study period.
The exposure-response curves between ambient temperature and ACS hospitalizations were inverse "J-shaped."
The effects of extreme low temperature on ACS hospitalizations occurred on the present day and lasted for 3 days, followed by the harvesting effect.
The effects of extreme high temperature occurred on the present day and lasted for 5 days.
The cumulative relative risks of ACS were 2.14 [95% confident interval (CI): 1.32 to 3.47] for extremely low temperature and 1.66 (95% CI: 1.33 to 2.06) for extremely high temperature over the lag of 0-5 days, compared with the reference temperature (25.0 Â°C).	5,43,47.5,126,130.2,34,37.2,185,209.1,96,121.1,158,184.6,229,260	1,3.1,4.2,3.2,4.1,5.2,6.1,7.2,7
Both low and high temperatures were significantly associated with higher risks of emergency hospital admissions for ACS in Yancheng, China.
