The Effects of Blue Light-Filtering Intraocular Lenses on the Protection and Function of the Visual System.
Filtration of high-energy short-wave visible light (blue light) to improve vision and protect against damage has evolved both in aquatic animals and terrestrial species.
In humans, pigments in the inner layer of the macula absorb wavelengths between 400 and 520 nm and function to improve visual performance.
In patients who undergo cataract surgery, replacing cataractous lenses with artificial intraocular lenses (IOLs) that do not mimic normal healthy adult lenses could result in preventable negative visual effects, including glare disability.
Blue light-filtering (BLF) IOLs were designed to filter short-wave light in addition to ultraviolet light and mimic the natural crystalline lens.
Current studies indicate that BLF IOLs may provide protection from blue light-induced retinal damage and slow the development and progression of age-related macular degeneration.
Additionally, BLF IOLs have been shown to improve chromatic contrast, reduce photostress recovery time, reduce glare disability and discomfort, and generally improve visual performance under glare conditions.
Although a number of concerns have been raised about the relative risks versus the benefits of BLF IOLs, recent studies reported no adverse effects on visual function or contrast under photopic conditions, no long-term effects on color vision, and no detrimental effects on circadian rhythms with BLF IOLs.
Based on the current understanding of the field, evidence suggests that BLF IOLs would be returning the eye to a more natural state compared with non-BLF lenses.
