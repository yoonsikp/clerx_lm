Apolipoprotein B, Triglyceride-Rich Lipoproteins, and Risk of Cardiovascular Events in Persons with CKD.
Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins may contribute to the high cardiovascular risk of patients with CKD.
This study evaluated associations of apo-B and markers of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins with cardiovascular events in people with CKD.
Analyses were conducted in 9270 participants with CKD in the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP): 6245 not on dialysis (mean eGFR 26.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2), and 3025 on dialysis when recruited.
Cox regression methods were used to evaluate associations of lipids with incident atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic vascular events, adjusting for demographics and clinical characteristics.
Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated per 1 SD higher level for apo-B, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol (i.e., total cholesterol minus LDL cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol), non-HDL cholesterol, log triglyceride, and log ratio of triglyceride to HDL cholesterol.
During a median follow-up of 4.9 years (interquartile range, 4.0-5.5 years), 1406 participants experienced at least one atherosclerotic vascular event.
In multivariable adjusted models, positive associations with atherosclerotic vascular events were observed for apo-B (HR per 1 SD, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 1.27), triglycerides (1.06; 1.00 to 1.13), the ratio of triglyceride to HDL cholesterol (1.10; 1.03 to 1.18), and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol (1.14; 1.05 to 1.25).	3,132,136.3,193,197.3,260,264.3,328,332.2,62,93.1,112,117.1,122,130.1,178,191.1,218,258.1,285,326	1,6.2,8.3,9.4,10.1,7.2,7.3,7.4,7.1,5.2,5.3,5.4,5
By contrast, inverse associations with nonatherosclerotic vascular events were observed for each of these lipid markers: apo-B (HR per 1 SD, 0.92; 0.85 to 0.98), triglycerides (0.86; 0.81 to 0.92), the ratio of triglyceride to HDL cholesterol (0.88; 0.82 to 0.94), and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol (0.85; 0.77 to 0.94).	3,142,146.3,178,182.3,245,249.3,313,317.2,40,74.1,122,127.1,132,140.1,163,176.1,203,243.1,270,311.1,107,120	1,6.2,8.3,9.4,10.1,7.2,7.3,7.4,7.1,5.2,5.3,5.4,5.1,11.2,11.3,11.4,11
Higher apo-B, triglycerides, ratio of triglyceride to HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic vascular events in CKD.
Reducing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins using novel therapeutic agents could potentially lower the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in the CKD population.
