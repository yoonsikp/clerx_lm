Center, Gestational Age, and Race Impact End-of-Life Care Practices at Regional Neonatal Intensive Care Units.
To assess the impact of intercenter variation and patient factors on end-of-life care practices for infants who die in regional neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).
We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using the Children's Hospital Neonatal Database during 2010-2016.
A total of 6299 nonsurviving infants cared for in 32 participating regional NICUs were included to examine intercenter variation and the effects of gestational age, race, and cause of death on 3 end-of-life care practices: do not attempt resuscitation orders (DNR), cardiopulmonary resuscitation within 6 hours of death (CPR), and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies (WLST).
Factors associated with these practices were used to develop a multivariable equation.
Dying infants in the cohort underwent DNR (55%), CPR (21%), and WLST (73%).
Gestational age, cause of death, and race were significantly and differently associated with each practice: younger gestational age (<28 weeks) was associated with CPR (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-2.1) but not with DNR or WLST, and central nervous system injury was associated with DNR (1.6, 1.3-1.9) and WLST (4.8, 3.7-6.2).	4,173,176.4,279,282.4,303,306.1,109,144.2,165,168.1,224,253.2,274,277.2,297,301	1,4.1,5.2,6.3,6.2,7.3,8
Black race was associated with decreased odds of WLST (0.7, 0.6-0.8).	4,56,59.1,1,11.2,50,54	1,2.1,3
Between centers, practices varied widely at different gestational ages, race, and causes of death.
From the available data on end-of-life care practices for regional NICU patients, variability appears to be either individualized or without consistency.
