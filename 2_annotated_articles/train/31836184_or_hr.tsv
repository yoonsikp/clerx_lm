Predictors of progression free survival, overall survival and early cessation of chemotherapy in women with potentially platinum sensitive (PPS) recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) starting third or subsequent line(≥3) chemotherapy - The GCIG symptom benefit study (SBS).
Potentially platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (PPS ROC) is defined by a platinum-free interval of >6 months, and usually treated with platinum-based chemotherapy with variable response and benefit in women who have had 3 or more lines of chemotherapy(≥3).
We identified baseline characteristics (health-related quality of life[HRQL] and clinicopathological factors), associated with PFS, OS and early progression (within 8 weeks).
The goal is to improve patient selection for chemotherapy based on a nomogram predicting PFS.
HRQL was assessed with EORTC QLQ-C30/QLQ-OV28.
Associations with PFS and OS were assessed with Cox proportional hazards regression.
Variables significant in univariable analysis were included in multivariable analyses using backward elimination to select those significant.
Associations with stopping chemotherapy early were assessed with logistic regression.
378 women were enrolled, with median(m)OS and PFS of 16.6 months and 5.3 months, respectively.
The majority had ECOGPS 0-1.
Chemotherapy was stopped early in 45/378 participants (12%); with mOS 3.4 months (95% CI: 1.7-7.2).
Physical function(PF), role function(RF), cognitive function(CF), social function(SF), Global Health Status(GHS) and abdominal/GI symptoms(AGIS) were significant univariable predictors of PFS(p < 0.030).
SF remained significant after adjusting for clinicopathological factors; p = 0.03.
PF, RF, CF, SF, GHS and AGIS were significant univariable predictors of OS (p < 0.007); PF, RF, SF and GHS remained significant predictors of OS in multivariable models; p < 0.007.
Poor baseline PF and GHS were significant univariable predictors of stopping chemotherapy early (p < 0.007) but neither remained significant after adjusting for clinicopathological factors.
Baseline HRQL is simple to measure, is predictive of PFS and OS and when used in conjunction with clinicopathological prognostic factors, can assist with clinical decision making and treatment recommendations for women with PPSROC≥3.
