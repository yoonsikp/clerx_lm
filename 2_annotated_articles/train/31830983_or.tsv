Physician's knowledge and opinions on human papillomavirus vaccination: a cross-sectional study, Saudi Arabia.
In a transition period of prevention strategy against HPV infection and cervical cancer in Saudi Arabia, it becomes necessary to appraise physicians' preparedness to undertake the inherent actions and responsibilities, by evaluating their knowledge and opinions regarding HPV infection and vaccine.
A cross-sectional study carried out between Jan 2017 and Nov 2018, included 2000 physicians working in 21 public centers from the five regions of Saudi Arabia.
A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess physicians' perception about HPV infection prevalence (1 item), knowledge about HPV infection and vaccine (9 items), and opinions and attitudes toward vaccine (4 items).
A knowledge score (range 0-9) was calculated and adequate knowledge was assumed for a score ≥ median.
Factors associated with opinions and attitudes were explored and multivariate regression was used to analyze independent factors of inadequate knowledge (score < median).
Majority of the participants replied correctly to all knowledge questions, and 63.0% perceived HPV infection as a frequently encountered infection.
Median knowledge score was 8 and 62.0% had adequate knowledge (score ≥ 8).
Inadequate knowledge was independently associated with Saudi nationality (OR = 1.51, p = 0.003), practice level (resident: OR = 3.53, p < 0.001; junior OR = 1.67, p = 0.002), and non Ob-Gyne specialty (OR = 5.40, p < 0.001); in addition to disparities across region and age.	4,80,84.4,129,133.4,158,162.4,208,212.2,1,21.1,56,73.1,98,112.1,114,122.1,146,152.1,180,201	1,6.2,7.3,7.2,8.3,9.4,10.1,5.2,5.3,5.4,5
Among the participants, 7.6% were immunized and 41.2% accepted to receive the vaccine, while majority were favorable to have their children vaccinated (77.6%) and to include HPV vaccine in the local immunization program (69.6%).
Self-perceived underexposure to HPV infection (58.5%), lack of knowledge about the vaccine (21.1%) and being sexually inactive (14.7%) were the most frequently reported reasons for refusing the vaccine.
Overall negative attitude regarding vaccine was typically associated with male, older, Saudi, senior consultant in other than Ob/Gyn specialty.
Inadequate knowledge level as well as lowly perceived prevalence of HPV infection were associated with less favorable attitude to vaccination.
More specific educational interventions are warranted to trigger physicians' active engagement in the fight against HPV infection and cervical cancer.
Such interventions should demystify the HPV vaccine by exposing its efficacy, availability and safety, along with providing practical information about the vaccination procedure and goals to achieve successful prevention strategy.
