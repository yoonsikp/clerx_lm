Genetic variants of glutathione S-transferase and the risk of acute myeloid leukemia in a Saudi population.
This study aims to investigate the genetic association of acute myeloid leukemia and glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene polymorphisms in a Saudi population.
100 AML cases and 100 healthy controls were recruited from the Riyadh regional hospital.
In the GST gene, GSTM1 and GSTT1 variants were genotyped by multiplex PCR, and GSTP1 variants were genotyped by PCR-RFLP analysis.
Statistical analysis between AML cases and controls included anthropometric measurements and evaluation of the genotypic and allelic frequencies.
The null genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1 showed no association with AML [OR 0.56 (0.26-1.19); p = 0.31 and OR 0.65 (0.37-1.16); p = 0.14].	4,74,78.4,108,112.1,5,19.1,23,28.1,33,38.2,66,69	1,3.2,3.1,4.2,5.1,6.2,6
Similarly, the GSTP1 genotype and allele frequencies did not indicate any association with AML [GG + AG vs. AA: OR 0.75 (0.43-1.31) and p = 0.32; GG vs. AA: OR 1.73 (0.55-5.44) and p = 0.34; G vs. A: OR 0.95 (0.61-1.46) and p = 0.82].	4,116,120.4,161,165.4,204,208.1,16,30.1,35,53.2,92,95.1,97,104.6,109,111.1,147,149.6,154,156.1,192,193.6,198,199	1,6.2,6.3,6.1,4.2,4.3,4.1,5.2,5.3,5.1,7.1,8.2,9.2,10.3,11.3,12
Further, a haplotype analysis between AML cases and controls did not show any positive association (p < 0.05).
In conclusion, there was no statistical association of the genotypes and alleles in GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 with AML.
Our results confirm the negative association of the investigated genetic markers with susceptibility to AML.
Further association studies would be required in different ethnic populations to facilitate a meta-analysis in the future.
Our findings suggest that the GST gene has no role in the pathogenesis of AML in patients from Saudi Arabia.
