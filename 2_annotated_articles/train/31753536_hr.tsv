Prevalence and Impact of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Atrial Fibrillation.
To estimate the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its impact on bleeding and thrombotic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
Prospective multicenter cohort study including patients with nonvalvular AF receiving vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) from February 2008 for patients on VKA and from September 2013 for patients on NOACs.
NAFLD was diagnosed using the validated fatty liver index, with a cutoff score of 60 or higher.
Primary end points were the occurrence of major bleedings and cardiovascular events (CVEs).
NAFLD was diagnosed in 732 of 1735 (42.2%) patients.
Patients with NAFLD were younger, less frequently women, and more likely to be treated with NOACs and to have obesity, dyslipidemia, and persistent/permanent AF.
During a median follow-up of 18.7 months (3155 patient-years), we recorded 78 major bleedings (incidence rate, 2.5% per year): 29 (2.1% per year) in patients with and 49 (2.7% per year) in patients without NAFLD (log-rank test P=.23).
Univariate Cox proportional regression analysis showed no association of NAFLD with major bleedings (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.47-1.20; P=.23).	3,116,120.1,74,79.2,85,100	1,2.1,3
One hundred fifty-five CVEs occurred (incidence rate, 3.1% per year).
No significant association was found between NAFLD and CVEs (log-rank test P=.12).
In the entire population, NOAC use was associated with lower CVEs compared with VKAs (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.89; P=.01).	3,101,105.1,27,35.2,62,66.6,81,85	1,2.1,3.1,4
NAFLD is highly prevalent in AF but is not associated with higher bleeding or thrombotic risk.
