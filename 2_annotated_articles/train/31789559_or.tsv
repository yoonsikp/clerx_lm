Long-term trajectories of depression symptoms in mothers of children with cancer.
To identify trajectories of depression symptoms in mothers of children with cancer from diagnosis/relapse through 5 years and examine maternal factors at diagnosis/relapse predicting membership in these trajectories.
Mothers (n = 327; Mage = 37.6 years, SD = 7.7 years; 85.9% White) reported depression symptoms near the time of their child's diagnosis/relapse and then again at 1-, 3-, and 5-years postdiagnosis/relapse.
Mothers also reported perceived stress, coping (primary control, secondary control, and disengagement coping), and spirituality near the time of diagnosis.
Latent class growth analysis was used to identify latent trajectories of depression symptoms, and a 3-step multinomial logistic regression tested covariate predictors of membership in the trajectories.
Three trajectories were identified: "low depression symptoms" (63.3%), "moderate depression symptoms" (31.5%), and "high depression symptoms" (5.2%).
Mothers who used more primary and secondary control coping were more likely to be in the low depression symptom trajectory as compared with the moderate (OR = 1.64, p = .024 and OR = 1.38, p = .013, respectively) or high trajectories (OR = 1.99, p = .008 and OR = 1.81, p = .001, respectively).	4,160,164.4,184,188.4,241,245.4,265,269.1,1,8.1,23,30.1,35,44.1,45,59.2,90,123.6,145,153.6,217,221.6,222,234	1,5.2,5.3,5.4,5.1,6.2,7.3,6.4,7.1,8.2,8.3,8.4,8.1,9.2,9.3,9.4,9.1,10.2,10.3,11.4,11.1,12.2,12.3,12.4,12
Although mothers of children with cancer generally displayed improved mental health further from diagnosis, mothers with more depression symptoms after diagnosis/relapse displayed substantial stability in depression symptoms over the 5 years.
Mothers of children with cancer may benefit from early screening of mental health and coping strategies, as well as interventions to bolster effective coping for those with elevated depression symptoms.
