A Randomized, Double-Blind, Efficacy and Safety Study of PF-05280586 (a Rituximab Biosimilar) Compared with Rituximab Reference Product (MabThera®) in Subjects with Previously Untreated CD20-Positive, Low-Tumor-Burden Follicular Lymphoma (LTB-FL).
Biosimilars are highly similar to the licensed biologic ("reference product"), with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, or potency between the two products.
This comparative 52-week clinical study evaluated the efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of PF-05280586 (Ruxience™ [a rituximab biosimilar]) versus rituximab reference product sourced from the EU (MabThera®; rituximab-EU).
Subjects with CD20-positive, low-tumor-burden follicular lymphoma (LTB-FL) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1 were randomized (1:1) to PF-05280586 or rituximab-EU (375 mg/m2 intravenously [once weekly for 4 weeks at days 1, 8, 15, and 22]), stratified using the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index 2 classification.
The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) at week 26 (percentage of subjects achieving complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]).
Therapeutic equivalence was concluded if the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in ORR between groups was within the prespecified margin (± 16%).
Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), CR rate, safety, immunogenicity, PK, and PD.
A total of 394 subjects were randomized: PF-05280586 (n = 196) or rituximab-EU (n = 198).
ORR at week 26 was 75.5% (PF-05280586) versus 70.7% (rituximab-EU), for a difference of 4.66%; 95% CI (- 4.16 to 13.47), which was entirely within the prespecified equivalence margin.
Rates of CR were 29.3% (PF-05280586) versus 31.0% (rituximab-EU).
Estimated 1-year PFS rates were 78.2% (95% CI 70.2-84.2) and 83.0% (95% CI 75.0-88.6) for PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU, respectively.
Safety, immunogenicity, and mean serum concentrations were similar between groups.
The efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, PK, and PD of PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU were similar up to week 52 in subjects with previously untreated CD20-positive LTB-FL.
