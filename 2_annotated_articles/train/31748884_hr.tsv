Laparoscopic Major Hepatectomy: Do Not Underestimate the Impact of Specimen Extraction Site.
In laparoscopic major hepatectomy, analysis of outcomes according to specimen extraction site remains poorly described.
The aim was to compare postoperative outcomes according to specimen extraction site.
From 2000 to 2017, all laparoscopic major hepatectomies were reviewed and postoperative outcomes were analyzed according to specimen extraction site: subcostal (Group 1), midline (Group 2), or suprapubic (Group 3) incision.
Among 163 patients, 15 (9.2%) belonged to Group 1, 49 (30.1%) in Group 2, and 99 (60.7%) in Group 3.
The proportion of right-sided, left-sided, or central hepatectomies, mortality, and overall and severe complications were comparable between groups.
Group 1 had larger tumors (61 vs. 38 vs. 47 mm; P = 0.014), higher operative time (338 vs. 282 vs. 260 min; P < 0.008), higher adjacent organ resection rate (46.6 vs. 16.3 vs. 7.1%; P < 0.001), and tended to increase pulmonary complications (40.0 vs. 12.2 vs. 18.2%; P = 0.064).
In Group 2, a previous midline incision scar was more frequently used for specimen extraction site (65.3 vs. 26.6 and 30.3%, Group 1 and 3; P < 0.001).
Postoperative incisional hernia was observed in 16.4% (n = 23) and was more frequent in Group 2 (26.6 vs. 6.6% and 10.1%, Group 1 and Group 3; P = 0.030).
Finally, Group 2 (HR 2.63, 95% CI 1.41-3.53; P = 0.032) was the only independent predictive factor of postoperative incisional hernia.	1,10,17.2,103,134.3,22,26	3,1.3,2
While using a previous incision makes sense, the increased risk of postoperative incisional hernia after midline incision promotes the suprapubic incision.
