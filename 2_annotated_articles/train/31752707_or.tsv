Predictors of clinical outcomes after cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients ≥75 years of age: a retrospective cohort study.
Cardiac resynchronization therapy has been shown to benefit selected patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.
Older patients have been underrepresented in randomized trials.
This study was conducted to determine whether predictive factors for cardiac resynchronization therapy outcomes differ in patients older and younger than 75 years of age.
Consecutive patients who received a cardiac resynchronization device cardiac resynchronization therapy between 2013 and 2016 in our center were retrospectively included in this cohort study.
The primary endpoint was cardiac resynchronization therapy effectiveness, which was defined as survival for one year with both no heart failure hospitalization and improvement by one or more NYHA class.
The secondary endpoints were mortality, complications, and device therapies.
Among the 243 patients included, 102 were ≥ 75 years old.
Cardiac resynchronization therapy effectiveness was observed in 70 patients (50%) < 75 years old and in 48 patients (47%) ≥75 years old (p = 0.69).
NYHA class ≥III (OR = 6.02; CI95% [1.33-18.77], p = 0.002) was a predictive factor for cardiac resynchronization therapy effectiveness only in the ≥75-year-old group, while atrial fibrillation was independently negatively associated with the primary endpoint in the < 75-year-old group (OR = 0.28; CI95% [0.13-0.62], p = 0.001).	4,23,27.4,293,297.1,1,16.2,88,135.1,148,166.1,174,193.2,243,259.1,267,286	1,3.1,4.1,5.2,6.2,7.2,8
The one-year mortality rate was 14%, with no difference between age groups.
Rescue cardiac resynchronization therapy and atrial fibrillation were independent predictive factors for mortality in both age groups.
Eighty-two complications occurred in 45 patients (19%), with no difference between groups.
Defibrillator use and QRS duration were independent predictive factors for complications in both age groups.
There was no difference between groups considering device therapies.
At one year, cardiac resynchronization therapy response is not compromised by patient age.
In older patients, highly symptomatic individuals with NYHA class ≥III have better outcomes after cardiac resynchronization therapy.
