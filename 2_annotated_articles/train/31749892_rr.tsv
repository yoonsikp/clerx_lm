Responsible Research and Innovation as a Novel Approach to Guide Educational Impact of Mind, Brain, and Education Research.
We propose a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) framework to improve the alignment between mind, brain, and education (MBE) research, the educational practice, and other societal stakeholders.
RRI is an approach that has successfully been used in different research fields, but not yet in MBE research.
After substantiating the need for, and possibilities of using this framework within MBE research, we report a case study to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of RRI within an MBE context.
This case study entails developing an educational intervention to improve learners' sense of agency regarding their own learning processes using neurofeedback.
Using RRI, we found that societal stakeholders (teenagers, parents, and teachers) anticipate different potential impacts of this neurotechnology-based intervention than researchers did, enabling us to adapt the intervention according to these perspectives.
This example demonstrates that RRI enables researchers to be reflexive and responsive to the stakeholders needs and values, to ultimately improve the educational and societal value of MBE research.
